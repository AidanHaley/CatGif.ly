# CatGif.ly
This is an SwiftUI app which retreives a collection of cat gifs and displays them to the user. 

# Getting Started
The app does not use any external frameworks so will not require any setting up.

Everything is done on application load, all you have to do is make sure you have an internet connection!

# Using the App
The app is fairly straightforward, just look at the gifs and enjoy!

# Navigating the Code
The app is architected using MVVM and SwiftUI, all Components, Views, View Models and Services can be found in their respective folders.

# TO:DO
- Add more Unit Tests
- Fix whitespace around some gifs and adjust GifImageView to fit content correctly
- Pagination to improve performance and display more content

# Questions and Feedback
All questions and feedback are welcome!
